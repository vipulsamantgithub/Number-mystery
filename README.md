# Number-mystery
A simple Python-based number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 50. The program provides hints if the guessed number is too high or too low and keeps track of the number of attempts.  This project demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, exception handling, and user input in Python.
